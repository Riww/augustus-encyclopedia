can still build a bridge to the (now) smaller farmland sections to keep using them, although you cannot bridge the canyons left behind by the earthquake.

\par Apart from the earthquake, the only problem you might have is the high favor rating requirement. There aren't many opportunities to build up the favor rating, but you don't need to give any gifts to Caesar to pass the level, if you don't ha
ng around for TOO long.
\par 
\par To put food items (eg. Fruit) into a warehouse, tell the trade advisor to stockpile that item. You can only send fruit to the emperor if it's in a warehouse, not granary.

\par If you have any real problems with the favor rating, send gifts to Caesar, with 12 months between gifts.

\par \pard\plain \s18\widctlpar \f11\fs20 {\f4 This level introduces you to some of the more advanced problems in the game, and provides new challenges for you as a governor.
\par 
\par Here are some tips on how to deal with the new challenges:
\par 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 1.\tab}}\pard \s18\fi-360\li360\widctlpar\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlbody\pndec\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnhang{\pntxta .}}{\f4 
Fires - desert cities have a greatly increased fire risk, so you should build more prefects than usual, and spend even more time checking the fire risk overlay.
\par }\pard \s18\widctlpar{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\pndec }{\f4 
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 2.\tab}}\pard \s18\fi-360\li360\widctlpar\tx360{\*\pn \pnlvlbody\pndec\pnstart1\pnindent360\pnhang{\pntxta .}}{\f4 
Water - fountains in the desert only service a range of 3 tiles, instead of 4 (for central and northern cities). Therefore, if you've fashioned your earlier cities using 9x9 city blocks, you should change to 7x7 blocks, for the desert.
\par }\pard \s18\widctlpar{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\pndec }{\f4

Population - this level calls for double the population of the previous levels. As a result you will need to build more of everything, and that makes it more difficult to keep an eye on every little detail. Therefore, make sure you build all parts of your
 city such that they can look after themselves for extended periods of time. If they can't look after themselves, you will be permanently fighting fire all over the city!
\par }\pard \s18\widctlpar{\*\pn \pnlvlcont\pndec }{\f4

Invasions - Greek soldiers will invade you from two points of the map. If you preempt the invasion points and surround them with walls and towers, you will never need to build any forts. However, you are free to make city defense more "interesting" by bui
lding walls and towers around the city if you wish, plus a few forts. The invading force is always the same approximate size (between half dozen to a dozen troops).

Choices - Miletus has plenty of open spaces, and the choice between coastline (fishing) or farmland (fruit) as your population center, is not a very straightforward one. I'd recommend building around the larger farmland, because your farms, docks and hous
es must all be together, for the purposes of exporting oil and importing clay. The farmland can support 18 farms, and you should use 2 or 3 of those for olive farms.

ld a ship bridge from the coast (near the farms) to the first large island. Use this island to build more wharves. That should give you enough fish (along with the 15 fruit farms) to feed all of your people.

Occasional landslides will stop land traders from reaching your city for a few months. Be prepared for these cuts in your main source of income, by keeping city funds at 1000 to 2000 Dn. Don't spend every cent as soon as you earn it. Otherwise you'll go i

Pause the game at the beginning and build aqeducts around the 2 packs of wolves (they work just as well as walls, for wolf control, and cost less). Build a javelin unit later on, and move them near the wolves. They can shoot over the aqueducts to kill the
 wolves, and can do it quickly enough to stop any wolves from being reborn. Once the javelin unit has been built, demolish the barracks to reclaim some workers.

Try to fit 99% of your population in the natives' area, between the two farmlands. If you can't manage this, the next best thing is to build on the large farming hill. Try not to build anything but houses and the bare necessity services in this population
 center. This way, you'll have less trouble letting people live near the food supplies, and also it may encourage you to keep away from building more services than you need, and that will help alleviate pressure on workforce shortages.

Don't import vines to make wine. You can achieve the prosperity rating without building any villas. If you do build villas that will only make matters worse because of the workforce shortage problem. You can, and will want to, achieve the prosperity by ha

Don't get your population too high too early. Take some time to get the food production & storage well and truly rolling along, before you build any markets. 5 to 10 full granaries would be my suggested minimum before building any markets. If you like, yo
u can segregate your housing into sectors using gatehouses. This
 way, you can build markets for one sector before the others, and gradually phase in the initial food grab. After the initial grab for food, empty out and then demolish any granaries that are just taking up space. 4 half-full granaries are not as good as 
2 full ones. You also save on workers.

Right click on your granaries and warehouses, and use the special orders screen to set some of them to "get" certain types of food & goods. The granaries furthest from farms (and coincidentally, should be nearest to houses) should get the food from other 
granaries. This saves your market ladies some legwork, so that they can spend more time making subsequent trips to either get more food, or to get other types of goods.

Don't build barbers until you're nearly finished. In the meantime, fill up one warehouse full of oil, and stop. Leave the advisor on "importing" oil, but don't let any other warehouses accept it. This will help you spend less on imports, while improving t
urn-around time for the traders from Massilia, who buy marble and pottery. When the end is within sight, build t

Tarsus is a transition level, and it will introduce you to the most difficult aspects of Caesar III. You are not required to master these difficult aspects right here, but you must show a reasonable grasp of them bef
ore your next career promotion. Assuming you have mastered the lessons of earlier levels, Tarsus should actually be pretty straightforward, because the enormous export trade will help you to overcome almost any mistake.

Don't believe everything you're told in the mission briefing. Although you have no farmland, you do have fishing grounds on this level. Fish should be the staple of your people's diet. 15 to 20 wharves should do the trick.

Goods distribution - When you import food (wheat), it will go from the docks to a warehouse to a granary to markets, and only then will it be distributed to your people. Considering this long distribution chain, you would be best served to keep the docks,
 warehouse, granary, markets, and houses all within a fairly close proximity. The wide-open spaces on this level are nice, but don\rquote 
t build TOO far away from the coast. I'd recommend locating your city on the western side of the map, with a bridge connecting
 it to marble & iron industries on the large island. Build the warehouses and docks on the mainland side, to speed up wheat and clay imports.

Importing food - you will need to import wheat, but you must not rely on it as being your primary source of food. Imported food is for variety ONLY. This variety is required mainly for building villas, but that does not stop your market ladies from trying
 to get it and distribute it to plebian houses anyway! It helps if you locate the villas and their markets closer to the wheat granaries, than the plebian housing blocks.

Exports - the only new aspect to exports is the sheer scope of it on this level. If you maximise your marble trade (10 quarries) and weapons (4 mines & 8 workshops) you'll be laughing all the way to the bank. Mastering the trade routes will make all your 
other problems MUCH easier to deal with.

Food preference - if you have a single granary which holds 100 units of wheat and 1500 units of fish, the market ladies will go for the wheat alm
ost every time. There's not a lot you can do about it, but keep it in mind as you are laying down your warehouses and granaries.

Personally, I thought (and still think that) Valentia is redundant in the peaceful career. There are virtually no significant new challenges offered here, compared to what the player already achieved in Tarsus. However, as I began to build this city, it b
ecame more and more enjoyable, because the city can produce all of its own food and goods, can make a decent income from exports, and building luxury palaces for the first time is just very satisfying.
\par 
\par Most of the fishing grounds are very close to the coast, which makes the fishing industry very efficient on this level. In fact, you can comfortably feed about 500 people for each wharf. I\rquote 
d highly recommend building a lot of your plebian housing blocks along the coast, and just feed them fish.
\par 
\par The trick with the population requirement is to pace yourself. Don't stretch your budget too thin by trying to lay out the entire skeleton of every housing block all at once. Estimate where you are going to build them, and concentrate on building one bloc
k at a time. Build each block in a way to make them self sufficient - you don't want to constantly fiddle around with all of them or you'll go mad.

hem, and keep the undesirable buildings further away. You only need 3 types of food to satisfy the patricians, so don't bother to import fruit. Make your own wine, wind down the export wine industry, and then tell the trade advisor to import wine as well.
 T
hus you have two sources of wine, and this will let you evolve beyond grand villas, all the way up to luxury palaces, which is the ultimate housing level in Caesar III. Don't connect the palace block's road network to your plebian housing blocks, so that 
your plebian houses do not "accidentally" evolve into villas. Reserve the hippodrome for your patricians, as they are the only ones who need it.
\par 
\par Once your luxury palaces are stable enough (ie. Not devolving frequently), check your finance advisor. It's pro
bably worthwhile to increase both the tax rate and wages (from the labor advisor), and demolishing your export industry. If your patricians are paying more taxes than you can spend, then the export industry is just taking up extra workers. Those workers m
ay be better put to use elsewhere (I had 10,000+ population and was still suffering worker shortage, with only 8 luxury palaces!)

\par \pard\plain \s18\widctlpar \f11\fs20 {\f4 Several interesting challenges await you on this level. Here are some tips on dealing with them:
\par 
\par }\pard \s18\fi-426\li426\widctlpar {\f4 1.\tab Starting out...
\par }\pard \s18\li426\widctlpar {\f4 Pause the ga
me to look around. You start out with a city that will soon burn to the ground if you do nothing about it. Some houses are already on fire. Delete the buildings next to them, to give yourself a fire barrier (so the fire can't spread).
\par 
\par Turn on the fire risk overlay, and delete the houses that are going to catch fire at any moment. If you don't want to get rid of the houses entirely, undo the deletes. This kicks the residents out, but leaves the house intact. The fire risk is neutralised
 until someone else moves into the house.
\par 
\par Now look around the road network, and build half a dozen or so prefects at strategic locations. Tell your labor advisor to set prefects as the no. 2 priority. Religion should always be no. 1 of course.
\par 
\par Build a temple to Mars, and two to Neptune.
\par 
\par Delete all facilities that are not needed, such as entertainment and education, markets, granary, fruit farms, and forum.
\par 
\par There's a group of zebras in the southeast edge. This is where you will be attacked from VERY SHORTLY. You have insuffi
cient time to build up soldiers or towers right there to repel them, so just build some walls to slow them down (at least 4 to 5 layers thick), and give your barracks enough time to train some tower guards for your city walls. These barbarians will make a
 beeline for your city. Note the direction of their attack, and bulk up the walls in that direction with towers. Remove towers from other parts, but fill the left over gaps with walls.
\par }\pard \s18\widctlpar {\f4 
\par }\pard \s18\fi-426\li426\widctlpar {\f4 2.\tab After the towers take care of the barbarians, spend the next few yea
rs building your city away from the starting position, but build slowly. Your export earnings on this level are far below Tarsus and Valentia, so exercise some patience.
\par 
\par 3.\tab Reserve the space between the coast and the central farmland, for your palace block. Build your plebian houses around the other couple of oasis.
\par 
\par 4.\tab When the invasions come, you will have a real fight on your hands. Towers alone are no longer sufficient to defeat the invaders. Prepare your troops for battle.
\par 
\par 5.\tab When Caesar requests an army, send at least 4 of your 6 legions, and you will win a Triumphal Arch.

\par There are 4 packs of wolves in Londinium. Surround them with aqueducts in the beginning, and deal with them later with a javelin unit.
\par 
\par This being a northern province, you have no fire risks to worry about, so keep the people in good mood, then you won't need to build prefectures.
\par 
\par The enemy's homeland is nearby, therefore you will have less warning time than usual. The Celtic invasion forces are very strong, so have your troops ready, and be prepared to take some losses. The final invasion (for me, October 63 AD) occurs roughly 30

\par \pard\plain \s16\widctlpar \f4\fs20 
Since the prosperity target is quite high, you will need to have many palaces and/or villas, which means you will only have a small percentage of your population available to your workforce. This will most likely stretch you to the limit. You will have to
 use every trick you know how, to overcome the worker shortage.

\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 3.\tab}Don\rquote t import weapons. Even though the invasion forces are very strong, Cavalry and Javelin throwers are sufficient to hold them off. You will take losses, but they can be replaced for free.

\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 5.\tab}Don\rquote t build extra entertainment and education until people are demanding it. Build more later when you are trying to meet the culture rating.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 6.\tab}Switch production off when the warehouses are full of a particular item. Don\rquote t let the workshops sit idly by and tie up valuable workers.
\par {\pntext\pard\plain\fs20 7.\tab}Build several vine farms and many wine workshops at the start, and stock up large amounts of wine. For the warehouses accepting wine, try to fill them to capacity. Once that\rquote 
s done, you can replace the vine farms with wheat or fruit farms, and set the trade advisor to import wine. By the time that traders start restocking
 your warehouses with wine, you should have many villas or palaces up and running, to help pay for the imports. You must leave one wine workshop in existence to make your residents think that they have 2 types of wine, but it\rquote 
s okay to turn the wine industry off.
