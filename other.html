<h3>Entertainment</h3>
Each house gets entertainment points in 5 categories:
<ol>
<li><b>Theater</b>: 0 or 10 points. Theater alone is worth 10. It doesn't matter whether the Theater has actors or not.
<li><b>Tavern</b>: 0, 10, or 15 points. No Tavern, Tavern without resources or Tavern with meat/fish only is worth 0 points. Wine gives 10, and wine+meat/fish is 15.
<li><b>Amphitheather</b>: 0, 10, or 15 points. Amphitheater alone is 0, with actors or gladiators 10, with both of them 15.
<li><b>Arena/Colosseum</b>: 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 points. 5 points is for Colosseum completed. 10 is Arena access with lions or gladiators only and no Colosseum. 15 is like 10, but with Colosseum completed somewhere. 20 is Arena with both gladiators and lions OR Colosseum with gladiators or lions. 25 means Arena access with both gladiators and lions and Colosseum completed somewhere. 30 means Colosseum access with both gladiators and lions, Arena isn't needed.<br>
<table border=1><tr><th>&nbsp;               <th>Access only <th>glad/lions <th>both  
<tr><th>Arena access, no Colosseum           <td> 0          <td> 10        <td> 20
<tr><th>Arena access + Colosseum somewhere   <td> 5          <td> 15        <td> 25
<tr><th>Colosseum access (Arena isn't needed)<td> 5          <td> 20        <td> 30</table>
<li><b>Hippodrome</b>: 0, 5, or 35 points: 5 for completed Hippodrome in the city, 35 with access. It doesn't matter whether or not it has chariots.
</ol>
If Venus GT is build and Genetrix epithet bestowed, Venus priests could provide 10 more points.

<h3>Emperor requests army</h3>
<b>Soldiers for army requests:</b>
<ul>
<li>Academy trained Legionary: 3.
<li>untrained Legionary or Academy trained Javelin/Mounted: 2.
<li>untrained Javelin/Mounted: 1.
</ul>
Be sure not to send more than 255, as this causes overflow.
<h3>Favor/Prosperity calculations</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Army request:</b> distant battle won: Favor +25, free Thriumphal Arch; distant battle lost: Favor -10; troops arrive late: Favor -25; ignore request completely: Favor -50.
<li><b>Goods request:</b> meet: scenario specific Favor Bonus; initial failure: Favor -3; meet late: Favor +Bonus/2; complete failure: Favor -5.
<li><b>Salary:</b> less than correct salary: Favor -1 per year; correct salary: Favor -2 per year; more than correct salary: additional Favor -1 per year and rank + difficulty based
<li><b>Money:</b> first debt: Favor -5, Prosperity -3; year later: Favor -10; two years of debt: Favor set to 10 and face Roman legions in a year if Favor &lt; 35.
<li><b>Tribute:</b> failure to pay Tribute first year: Favor -3, Prosperity -3; second year: Favor -5, Prosperity -3; third year: Favor -10, Prosperity -3.
<li><b>Economy:</b> lose money: Prosperity -1; make profit: Prosperity +2; unemployment &gt; 15%: Prosperity -1; unemployment &lt; 5%: Prosperity +1.
<li><b>Wages:</b> below Rome: Prosperity -1; at least 2 Dn more than Rome: Prosperity +1.
<li><b>Housing quality:</b> less than 30% of population in tents or shacks: Prosperity +1; 10% or more population in villas or pallaces: Prosperity +1.
<li><b>Other:</b> people below Grand Insulae have more than one type of food: Prosperity +1; active Hippodrome: Prosperity +1.
</ul>

<h3>Sentiment &amp; Crime</h3>
Sentiment Level (SL) is calculated for each house, can range 0-100. City Sentiment (CS) is average SL. New houses are created at SL=CS+10. SL goes +2 or -2 each month towards SSL (Stabilized Sentiment Level). SSL = SL + SV (Sentiment Variation). SV depends on 7 factors:
<ul>
<li><b>Tax rate:</b> -6/-5/-4/-3/-2 (difficulty) per % point above neutral rate (see above Difficulty table), or +3/+3.5/+4/+4.5/+5 per % point below neutral rate. Houses not visited by tax collectors get +9/+12/+16/+20/+25 (difficulty), regardless of current tax rate, but only if at least 50% of population is taxed.
<li><b>Wages:</b> +2 for each Dn paid above Rome, -3 for each Dn paid below Rome. Patricians are unaffected.
<li><b>Unemployment:</b> -1 for each % of unemployment above 5%. Patricians are unaffected.
<li><b>Food:</b> +12 for each food type beyond what is required, but max +24. Tents cannot get this bonus as they don't stock food.
<li><b>Entertainment:</b> +1 for each point of entertanment above what is required, but max +24.
<li><b>Desirability:</b> +0.5 for each point of positive desirability, but max +housing level (meaning Small Tents can get +1 max, Luxury Palaces +20).
<li><b>Housing inequalities:</b> -1 for each level difference vs average housing level, multiplied by 3 for tents (levels 1-2), by 2 for Small Shacks to Small Casa (levels 3-7). Grand Insulaes and patricians never suffer from housing inequalities. However, as the city grows, average housing level can be considered higher than actually is (each 1000 population +1 level, up to level 9 Small Insulae at 9000+ population).
</ul>

Low SL (less than 50) leads to crime. 
<ul>
<li><b>45-49:</b> protester (does nothing, provides warning).
<li><b>30-44:</b> robber (seeks to steal funds from Forum or Senate).
<li><b>20-29:</b> looter (seeks to steal goods from Granaries or Warehouses).
<li><b>15-19:</b> 2 looters.
<li><b>0-14:</b> if at least 5% of housing have SL &lt; 25, up to 20 roobers, looters, and rioters (burn buildings) spawn, otherwise 3 robbers + 3 looters.
</ul>
Each spawned criminal grants +5 SL.

<h3>Health &amp; Sickness</h3>
Health Rating (HR) is calculated for each house, can range 0-100. It is calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>House Level: +level/2 (0-10)
<li>Baths access: +20
<li>Barber access: +10
<li>Doctor access: +30 / Hospital access: +40 / Both: +50
<li>Mausoleums: +1 for each small, +2 for each large in the city, but max +10
<li>Food: +15 per food type eaten
</ul>

HR is used as percentage to calculate average City Healthcare (CH) as a % of healthy population (for example, 1 house with HR=50% and pop=100 and 1 house with HR=20% and pop=50 means we have 60 healthy pop out of 150, so CH=40%). This can be approximated from the top line of Health Advisor (appaling: 0-9%, terrible: 10-19%, bad: 20-29%, poor: 30-39%, below average: 40-49%, average: 50-59%, good: 60-69%, very good: 70-79%, excellent: 80-89%, almost perfect: 90-99%, perfect: 100%). City Healthcare Level (CHL) is exactly this rating (appaling is level 0, perfect is level 10). House Health Level (HHL) is calculated accordingly by translating HR. City Population Level (CPL) increases by 1 for each 1000 population, but max 10 for 10000+ pop.<p>

Sickness Value (SV) is calculated for each house, Dock, Granary, and Warehouse. Furthermore, every cart pusher is either infested or not (they have no infestation value). Cart pushers become infested by visiting trade building with SV% chance. In trade buildings, SV +1 for each good traded, and SV +1 for each infested trader visit. Infested cart pushers have 1/6 chance to contaminate houses they pass. Contaminated house's SV increases/decreases according to the following table (CPL is top row, HHL is left column):<p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>CPL<br>HHL <th>0  <th>1  <th>2  <th>3  <th>4  <th>5  <th>6  <th>7  <th>8  <th>9  <th>10
<tr><th>0          <td>+10<td>+8 <td>+6 <td>+4 <td>+2 <td>0  <td>-2 <td>-4 <td>-6 <td>-8 <td>-10

</table><p>

<b>But, each new month, SV in buildings will also decrease by CH% (city healthcare).</b> However in case of positive SV increment (table above), there is a malus to CH%, which is five times the SV increase in % (-50% malus for +10 SV). It means in houses, the better HR, the more efficient CH. In addition, good Hospital city coverage provides CH% bonus (None,Sparse=0%, Very poor,Poor=5%, Below average,Average=10%, Above average,Good=15%, Very good,Excellent=20%, Perfect=25%. Finally, if SV is decreased to 0 in any building after HC% has been applied, sickness won’t grow anymore unless a trader visits it again (trade buildings) or an infected cart pusher walks near it again (houses).<p>

<b>Plague</b><br>
If SV reaches 200 in a trade building or 100 in a house, the building is <b>plagued</b>. 

<ul>
<li>Plagued trade buildings stop working, until a doctor or surgeon fumigates it for a few months. Then it's back to working and SV is set to 0. But, Warehouse loses 100% of stored food and 50% of other goods. Granary loses 50% of stored food. Docks are fine.
<li>If plagued houses's HR&lt;40, it's burned down and all residents die. If &gt;40, 100-HR% of residents die and it becomes quarantined for few months, after which immigrants can move in.
</ul>
